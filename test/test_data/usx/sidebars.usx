    <para style="p" vid="JON 1:2">Jona thinks that he can outwit God. He does not set out for Nineveh, the capital of Assyria. He turns exactly the other direction: towards Tarshish in Spain. He runs away <char style="qt">from the presence of God</char>. You may think that God does not notice it and that you yourself are in charge. In the meantime, it only results in misery and trouble.<verse eid="JON 1:2" />
