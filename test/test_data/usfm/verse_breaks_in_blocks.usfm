\toc1 The Book of Psalms
\mt1 Psalms
\c 1
\q1
\v 1 How fortunate are those who do not do what the wicked people advise them to do,
who do not imitate the behavior of sinful people,
and who do not join with people who ridicule God.
\v 2 Instead, those with whom Yahweh is pleased
delight in understanding what he teaches us.
\q1
They read and think every day and every night about what Yahweh teaches.
\v 3 They constantly do things that please God,
just as fruit trees that have been planted along the banks of a stream produce fruit at the right time every year.
\q1
Like trees that never wither, they succeed in everything that they do.
